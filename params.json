(beta)\r\nCadence Virtuose Git Integration written in SKILL++\r\n\r\n## What is CdsGit?\r\nCdsGit is a SKILL++ library written that allows a user to use\r\nGit to manage their cadence libraries. Unlike other Git clients,\r\nCdsGit is tailored to the cadence DFII infastructure and makes\r\ninterfacing with Cadence cells easy.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Full integration of common Git commands into Library manager\r\n* Dropdown menus in schematic/layout for version management\r\n* Schematic/Layout Diff tool (IN PROGRESS)\r\n* Schematic/Layout Merge tool (IN PROGRESS)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nInstallation is simple! Clone this repository and add to your .cdsinit\r\n```skill\r\nloadi('/your/path/to/cdsgit/load_cdsgit.il')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\nCdsGit is a work in progress. The framework for the project is fully laid\r\nbut there are many features that are still in progress such as the diff\r\nand merging capabilities. There are also a few bugs kicking around\r\nthat will be fixed in the near future.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
